# MMQ_App

* Youtube - Video explanation:

> This is a app that calculates the function using the least squares mathod, with measurement error propagation. The code was all done with python and I used tkinter as the principal package.
  The math was done all from skretch, there is no package that helped me with the calculos, so no sklearn, pandas, numpy or anything like that
